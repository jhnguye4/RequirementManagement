# RequirementManagement
# About
When implementing new software, developers must keep track of a large number of requirements. Managing requirements helps
developers decide what still needs to be implemented, what the priorities are, and make sure that nothing essential gets left out.
Software that enables developers to track the requirements are called requirements management systems. From quite small to very
large software projects, requirements management systems can be vital to ensure that all developers know what is left to implement
with their software. Requirements management systems reflect the different steps organizations take when working to implement
requirements. The process of managing requirements can be modeled as a finite-state machine (FSM).
